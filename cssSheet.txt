position: 
  types: absolute, relative, fixed, static
  
  position: static; static is the default position for all elements. static simply means the element will
  simply flow into the page as it normally would.
  
  position: relative; setting relative means 'relative to itself'. setting relative but not setting any
  other positioning attributes (top, bottom, left, right) will have no affect. It will remain in the same
  spot as static position. If we do change something like top: 10px; as well as setting relative, it will
  move the element down from where it normally would be, leaving a gap at the top and covering the element below it. Relative affects the z-index, meaning the element will now appear on top of the
  statically positioned elements.
  
  position: absolute; setting absolute will allow us to place the element anywhere we want it using 
  the other positioning attributes top, bottom, left, right. The element will be moved relative to the
  page. We can position an element relative to its parent element by giving the parent element a 
  position: relative; . Setting absolute will remove the element from the flow of the page, this element will not affect the flow of other elements or be effected by them. 
  
  position: fixed; setting fixed position positions the element relative to the viewport/browser.

  types:
  display: block; elements set to block are a rectangle of pixels. setting to block will allow us to set a width and a height.
